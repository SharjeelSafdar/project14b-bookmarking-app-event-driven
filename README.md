## Backend

This AWS CDK App deploys the backend infrastructure for [Project 13B](https://github.com/SharjeelSafdar/project13b-bookmarking-app-with-aws). The app consists of two stacks.

### Stack 1: AppSync GraphQL API and DynamoDB Table

It contanis of the AWS services used by the web client. It has the following constructs:

- A DynamoDB Table to contain the bookmarks saved by the users
- An AppSync GraphQL API (with real-time subscriptions) to access the bookmarks in the Table

### Stack 2: CloudFront Distribution and S3 Bucket

It contains the infrastructure to deploy frontend client. It has the following constructs:

- A S3 Bucket with public access to store the static assets of Gatsby web app
- A Cloud Front Distribution to serve the static assets through a CDN. It also has the error handling capability: redirects any `404s` to `/404.html`.
